# CVDL_project
My CVDL project - Satellite image retrieval using Siamese Neural Networks

Most of the code is written by me, I took inspiration from https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/siamese_network for the train/test loop and the Siamese Network model look, but I also modified those parts. I also took the code from the 'Seed everything' cell from a Kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/rhythmcam/random-seed-everything (it's used so that I can have the same start every time I run the project).

I downloaded the dataset from here: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html and uploaded it in my Google Drive (and then downloaded the data from there whenever I ran the project).
